This is a repository for bounties which are funded by the SCI. Click on issues to see open bounties! You can use labels to sort bounties by project, language, etc. If you are interested in contributing to bounties, you can contribute directly to individual bounties or [donate to us](https://thesciencecommons.org/donate/) on our website for a nice tax deduction. You can also support us (US users) when you shop at amazon or eBay, [click here]((https://thesciencecommons.org/donate/)) for more information.

The SCI is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to rebuilding the bridge of participation and trust between the public and the scientific process. We support tools and infrastructure that enable people to learn about and engage with science. Follow our work via [our free newsletter on substack](https://thesciencecommons.substack.com/).
