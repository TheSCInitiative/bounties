**Context: Why this bounty exists**

**Requirements to claim bounty:**

- Have experience doing xyz
- Implement features abc
- Submit code to x repo and have it approved by maintainers, following all coding standards used by the repo and making any style and other edits requested by them. In the event that your code is not accepted by maintainers but otherwise meets bounty requirements and solves the issue the bounty is for, the bounty will still be paid out. 

**Contribute to this Bounty**
You can contribute to SCI's bounty program via PayPal, CC, or Crypto on [our website](https://thesciencecommons.org/donate/). You will get a nice tax deduction, and we will spend those donated funds on our bounty programs. The higher the bounty, the more likely a developer will come along to claim it!

You can also donate to this bounty directly by sending crypto to the following addresses. The bounty awardee will receive all crypto sent to these addresses. Did you know that crypto is one of the most effective ways to make donations (for US donors)? Cryptocurrency donations to 501(c)3 nonprofits are considered tax-deductible and do not trigger a taxable event, meaning you do not usually have to pay capital gains tax on them. We request that any individual donating over $500USD (or equivalent) provide their information along with their donation to ensure compliance with our AML and KYC policies. Any organization that wishes to make a donation to SCI is requested to reach out to us directly at contact@thesciencecommons.org. In the event that the awardee does not want the crypto or the bounty is closed without being paid out, it will be turned over to SCI's bounty fund to be spent on future bounties.
